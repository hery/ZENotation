A MapKit annotation framework

## Timeline

* Sunday, Oct 09: Started project. Started focusing on UI. No groundbreaking performance feature.
* Monday, Oct 10: Dropping focus on UI. Came up with an aggregation idea to reduce the number of annotations visible on a given region without compromising on information loss.
